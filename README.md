<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Kate</h1>
<h3 align="center">An Android developer</h3>

- I’m currently working on [**My Dates**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kuzepa.mydates) app (it's currently published in Java, but I'm working on the [Kotlin version](https://github.com/mi-kuzeka/MyDatesKotlin))
- You might find my [MaskTextFieldCompose](https://github.com/mi-kuzeka/MaskTextFieldCompose) repository helpful for creating a custom mask for Jetpack Compose TextField.
